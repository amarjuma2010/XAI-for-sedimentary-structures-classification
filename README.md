# XAI-for-sedimentary-structures-classification
Sedimentary structures classifier (CPU-only, Windows). Runs EfficientNet-B2, ResNet-50, and MobileNet-V3 with Grad-CAM++ to explain predictions on outcrop/core photosâ€”no resizing to preserve textures. Supports 5 training folds per model and exports predictions (CSV) plus heatmaps.
